He underwent an IVP, which demonstrated enlarged prostate and normal upper tracts.  Cystoscopy in the office demonstrated a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor.  He is brought to the operating room for transurethral resection of that bladder tumor.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling of the patient and his wife, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthetic.  He was placed in lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Using the visual obturator, the resectoscope was then inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected confirming previous cystoscopic findings of a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor away from the ureteral orifice.  Using the resectoscope loop, the tumor was then resected down to its base in a stepwise fashion.  Following completion of resection down to the base, the bladder was _______ free of tumor specimen.  The resectoscope was then reinserted and the base of the bladder tumor was then resected to get the base of the bladder tumor specimen, this was sent as a separate pathological specimen.  Hemostasis was assured with electrocautery.  The base of the tumor was then fulgurated again and into the periphery out in the normal mucosa surrounding the base of the bladder tumor.  Following completion of the fulguration, there was good hemostasis.  The remainder of the bladder was without evidence of significant abnormality.  Both ureteral orifices were visualized and noted to drain freely of clear urine.  The bladder was filled and the resectoscope was removed.  A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The balloon was inflated to 30 mL.  The catheter with sterile continuous irrigation and was noted to drain clear irrigant.  The patient was then removed from lithotomy position.  He was in stable condition.","urology, turbt, bladder tumor, cystoscopic, resectoscope, hemostasis, foley catheter, tumor, bladder, lithotomy, transurethral, resection, hematuria,"

22, Normal vasectomy, Urology, Vasectomy - 1 ,"DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was placed in the supine position and was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The left vas was grasped in between the fingers.  The skin and vas were anesthetized with local anesthesia.  The vas was grasped with an Allis clamp.  Skin was incised and the vas deferens was regrasped with another Allis clamp.  The sheath was incised with a scalpel and elevated using the iris scissors and clamps were used to ligate the vas deferens.  The portion in between the clamps was excised and the ends of the vas were clamped using hemoclips, two in the testicular side and one on the proximal side.  The incision was then inspected for hemostasis and closed with 3-0 chromic catgut interrupted fashion.,A similar procedure was carried out on the right side.  Dry sterile dressings were applied and the patient put on a scrotal supporter.  The procedure was then terminated.","urology, vasectomy, allis clamp, catgut, hemoclips, iris scissors, scrotal, scrotal supporter, testicular, vas, vas deferens, vas was grasped, deferens, clampsNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

12, Cerebral Angiogram - moyamoya disease., Neurology, Moyamoya Disease ,"CC:, Confusion and slurred speech.,HX , (primarily obtained from boyfriend): This 31 y/o RHF experienced a ""flu-like illness 6-8 weeks prior to presentation. 3-4 weeks prior to presentation, she was found ""passed out"" in bed, and when awoken appeared confused, and lethargic. She apparently recovered within 24 hours. For two weeks prior to presentation she demonstrated emotional lability, uncharacteristic of her ( outbursts of anger and inappropriate laughter). She left a stove on.,She began slurring her speech 2 days prior to admission. On the day of presentation she developed right facial weakness and began stumbling to the right. She denied any associated headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, neck stiffness or visual change. There was no history of illicit drug/ETOH use or head trauma.,PMH:, Migraine Headache.,FHX: , Unremarkable.,SHX: ,Divorced. Lives with boyfriend. 3 children alive and well.

Utilized only one or two word answers/phrases. Non-fluent. Rarely followed commands. Impaired writing of name.,CN: Flattened right nasolabial fold only.,Motor: Mild weakness in RUE manifested by pronator drift. Other extremities were full strength.,Sensory: withdrew to noxious stimulation in all 4 extremities.,Coordination: difficult to assess.,Station: Right pronator drift.,Gait: unremarkable.,Reflexes: 2/2BUE, 3/3BLE, Plantars were flexor bilaterally.,General Exam: unremarkable.,INITIAL STUDIES:, CBC, GS, UA, PT, PTT, ESR, CRP, EKG were all unremarkable. Outside HCT showed hypodensities in the right putamen, left caudate, and at several subcortical locations (not specified).,COURSE: ,MRI Brian Scan, 2/11/92 revealed an old lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia, edema within the head of the left caudate nucleus suggesting an acute ischemic event, and arterial enhancement of the left MCA distribution suggesting slow flow. The latter suggested a vasculopathy such as Moya Moya, or fibromuscular dysplasia. HIV, ANA, Anti-cardiolipin Antibody titer, Cardiac enzymes, TFTs, B12, and cholesterol studies were unremarkable.,She underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/12/92. This revealed an occlusion of the left MCA just distal to its origin. The distal distribution of the left MCA filled on later films through collaterals from the left ACA. There was also an occlusion of the right MCA just distal to the temporal branch. Distal branches of the right MCA filled through collaterals from the right ACA. No other vascular abnormalities were noted. These findings were felt to be atypical but nevertheless suspicious of a large caliber vasculitis such as Moya Moya disease. She was subsequently given this diagnosis. Neuropsychologic testing revealed widespread cognitive dysfunction with particular impairment of language function. She had long latencies responding and understood only simple questions. Affect was blunted and there was distinct lack of concern regarding her condition. She was subsequently discharged home on no medications.,In 9/92 she was admitted for sudden onset right hemiparesis and mental status change. Exam revealed the hemiparesis and in addition she was found to have significant neck lymphadenopathy. OB/GYN exam including cervical biopsy, and abdominal/pelvic CT scanning revealed stage IV squamous cell cancer of the cervix. She died 9/24/92 of cervical cancer.",
